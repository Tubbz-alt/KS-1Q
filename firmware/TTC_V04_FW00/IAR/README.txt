                      SmartFusion2 MSS SPI loopback example
================================================================================

This example project demonstrates the use of the SmartFusion2 MSS SPI peripheral
device. It loops back communications between MSS SPI0 and MSS SPI1.

                            How to use this example
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Run the example project using a debugger. Place watches on the following buffers
buffers and observe the contents of the master and slave buffers being
exchanged.

  g_master_tx_buffer,
  g_master_rx_buffer,
  g_slave_tx_buffer,
  g_slave_rx_buffer

                                Target hardware
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This example project is targeted at any SmartFusion2 design where MSS SPI0 and
MSS SPI1 are enabled.

MSS SPI 0 is configured as Master and MSS SPI 1 is Configured as slave.

Connection details:
Connect MSS SPI 0 Data In (pin SPI_0_DI) to SPI 1 Data Out (pin SPI_1_DO).
Connect MSS SPI 0 Data Out (pin SPI_0_D0) to SPI 1 Data In (pin SPI_1_DI).
Connect MSS SPI 0 Chip select (pin SPI_0_SS0_M2F) to MSS SPI 1 Chip select 
        (pin SPI_1_SS0_F2M).
Connect MSS SPI 0 Clock (pin SPI_0_CLK_M2F) to MSS SPI 1 Clock 
        (pin SPI_1_CLK_F2M).

This example is built to execute on an M2S090 die. You will need to overwrite
this example project's "drivers_config/sys_config" and "CMSIS" folders with
the one generated by Libero for your hardware design if using a newer silicon
revision.
The "drivers_config/sys_config" folder contains information about your hardware
design. This information is used by the CMSIS to initialize clock frequencies
in global variables which are used by the SmartFusion2 drivers to derive baud
rates. The CMSIS boot code may also complete the device's clock configuration
depending on the silicon version. The "CMSIS" and "drivers_config/sys_config" 
for your design can be found in the "firmware" folder of your Libero design.
